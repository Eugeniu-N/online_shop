### online_shop

## About the project
This is a very basic online shop, you can browse items, add them to your cart (stored in the cookies), buy them (only if you are logged in). Currently to test the buy function you should only login with username "user" and password "user".

The project was done in 2 weeks where I learned from scratch javascript, html and spring boot. It's in a very primitive state, as I'm still learning the best practices and the most modern way of doing things rather than using old, slow, deprecated methods.
Edge cases both frontend and backend are not dealt with.

My objective now is refactoring code, adding more features, css and properly handling edge cases and exceptions as I learn and get more experience
